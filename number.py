# print(pow(5,3))

# a = [4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# print(max(a))

# + addition
# - substraction
# * multiplication
# / division
# % mod for example, 10%3 = 1 cuz its the rest 
# abs stands for absolute value
# pow makes it that we can put 2 numbers, the first one being the base and the second one being the pwoer its been printed at
# max makes that it prints the highest value of the list put in
# min makes that it prints the lowest value of the list put in

# math imports
# round rounding up number
# floor and ceil is chopping off the decimals while going up or down
